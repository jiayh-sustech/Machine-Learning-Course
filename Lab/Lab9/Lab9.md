# Lab 9 - K-means Clustering

## I. Introduction

**K-means** clustering is one of the simplest and popular **unsupervised** machine learning algorithms. The objective of *K-means* is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, *K-means* looks for a fixed number (*k*) of clusters in a dataset. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

In this lab, we will write a program to segment different objects in a video using *K-means* clustering. There are several steps:

- [x] Load video & extract frames
- [x] Implement *K-means* clustering
- [x] Write back to video

## II. Lab Practice

In this lab, you need following dependency:

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import tqdm
```

### (1) Video Handling

We use `opencv` to handle videos.

For reading a video, we have:

```python
# load video, get fps and size of each frame
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
fps = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))
size = (int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)),
        int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)))

# then, you can use read() to read a frame of a video
ret, frame = cap.read()
```

<font color=red>Pay attention</font> that data type of `frame` is `uint8`, not`int`; in this lab, frame has 3 channels.



You can write a frame as following:

```python
# intantiate a video write
video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(filename,
                               cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'),
                               fps,
                               size,
                               isColor=True)
# create a new frame with dtype (data type) in uint8
new_frame = np.array((h, w, c)).astype("uint8")
video_writer.write(new_frame)
```

<font color=red>Pay attention</font>: If you don't change `dtype` of frame into `unit8`, video you write will look strange which you can have a try.



### (2) K-means

In this lab, you need to implement K-means, the rough procedure is:

1. **initialize centroids** of different classes

   In the simplest case, randomly choose centroids in original data

2. **calculate distances** between samples (pixels) and centroids

   Since one sample (pixel) has 3 channels, you can calculate square sum of differences in each channel between it and centroids.
   $$
   dist(S,C) = \sum_{i=1}^3(C_i-S_i)^2 \\
   \left\{
   \begin{aligned}
   &dist(S,C): \text{distance between a sample S and a centroid C}\\
   &C: \text{a centroid}\\
   &S: \text{a sample}\\
   &S_i: \text{the } i^{th} \text{ channel's value of S}\\
   &C_i: \text{the } i^{th} \text{ channel's value of C}
   \end{aligned}
   \right.
   $$
   

3. **classify** every samples

   A sample is belonging to the class whose centroid is closest to it among all centroids.
   $$
   cls(S) = argmin(\sum_{i=1}^3(C_i^k-S_i)^2), k=1,2,...,K\\
   \left\{
   \begin{aligned}
   &cls(S): \text{class of a sample S}\\
   &K: \text{number of classes}\\
   &C^k: \text{centroid of } k^{th} \text{ class}\\
   \end{aligned}
   \right.
   $$

4. **update centroid**

   You can use mean of all samples in the same class to calculate new centroid.
   $$
   C^k_i =\frac{1}{n^k}\sum^{n^k}_{n=1}S^k_{in},\ \  i=1,2,3\\
   \left\{
   \begin{aligned}
   &C^k_i: \text{the } i^{th} \text{channel's value of a centroid belonging to the } k^{th} \text{class} \\
   &n^k: \text{the number of samples in the }  k^{th} \text{class}\\
   &S^k_{in}: \text{the } i^{th} \text{channel's value of a sample which is in the } k^{th} \text{class}
   \end{aligned}
   \right.
   $$
   

5. loop until classification result doesn't change



In addition, you may find there is code like this:

```python
while ret:
    frame = np.float32(frame)
    h, w, c = frame.shape
    ...
```

Since if you don't converse the `dtype`, K-means hardly converges which means it will stuck into dead loop easily.



After you finish K-means, you will find the written video is hard to watch because **color** between adjacent frames **changes almost all the time**. To alleviate this situation, you can use seed to initialize centroids which we offer you an interfere:

```python
def update_seed(n_cl, label, distance)
```

**It isn't compulsory**, you can try if you want.

### Questions

1. What are the strengths of K-means; when does it perform well?
2. What are the weaknesses of K-means; when does it perform poorly?
3. What makes K-means a good candidate for the clustering problem, if you have enough knowledge about the data?
